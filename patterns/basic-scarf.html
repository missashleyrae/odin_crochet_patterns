        <h2>Basic Scarf</h2>
        <img src="../img/basicscarf.jpg" height="496" width="744">
        <p class="intro">This is a simple scarf that's perfect for beginner crocheters. It'll give you a chance to learn and practice some of the basic skills you'll need before moving on to more challenging projects. This pattern produces a scarf that measures 84x4 inches wide, but don't worry if yours turns out slightly different because of yarn type or stitch tension. Just have fun learning as you go! </p>

        <h3>What You'll Need:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>a 6mm crochet hook</li>
            <li>a yarn needle</li>
            <li>scissors</li>
            <li>300 yards of worsted weight yarn</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to make the scarf:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make a foundation chain.</li>
                <p> Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-Il8OcNAZA">this video tutorial</a> if you're not sure how to make a foundation chain. Your foundation chain should be 230 chain stiches long. </p>

            <li>Single crochet into the chain.</li>
                <p>Starting in the second chain from your hook, work a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGHIU4010vY&t=14s">single crochet</a> ("sc") into each stitch across your whole starting chain. Count your stitches to make sure you have 230 stitches. At the end, do one more single crochet as a turning chain. Flip your work horizontally.</p>
            <li>Get started on the body of the scarf.</li>
                <p>Repeat the same process as in the last step, single crocheting into each stitch. When you were single crocheting into the foundation chain, you inserted your crochet hook into one loop to make the stitch. From here on out, there will be two loops. Make sure you push your crochet hook through both loops when you make your single crochet stitches. Remember to make a turning chain at the end of each row before flipping your work horizontally and continuing to single crochet. Continue this process until the scarf is as wide as you want it to be. </p>
            <li>The final row.</li>
                <p>When you get to the last row you want to crochet, repeat the same process you did for all the previous rows, except for one change: do not make a turning chain at the end, because it's time to finish your project!</p>
            <li>Finish your scarf.</li>
                <p>Cut the yarn, leaving a tail of at least six inches. Do not remove the loop from your crochet hook yet. Instead, wrap the tail of yarn around your hook, pull it through the loop, and tighten the knot.</p>
                <p>Thread the yarn tail onto a yarn needle and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IArPZig-Tl8">weave it in</a>. Do the same with the tail of yarn at the beginning of your project as well. </p>
        </ol>
