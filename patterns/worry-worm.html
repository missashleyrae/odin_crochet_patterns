    <h2>Crochet Worry Worm</h2>
    <img src="../img/worryworm.jpg">
    <p class="intro">This one is quick and simple: a cute little worry worm to keep in your pocket. It works great as a fidget for people who need them, and it's very fast to make so you can give them away to as many people as you want!</p>


    <h3>What You'll Need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yarn (any kind will do)</li>
        <li>An appropriately sized crochet hook (the wrapper on your yarn should suggest a hook size)</li>
        <li>Googly eyes or a second color of yarn to make eyes</li>
        <li>Scissors</li>
        <li>Yarn needle</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Make the Worry Worm:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Chain 30.</li>
        <li>Slip stitch into the second chain on your hook.</li>
        <li>Place 4 single crochet stitches into each of the chains until there's only one left.</li>
        <li>In the last chain, place 10 double crochet stitches (this is the head of your worry worm). Slip stitch into the same chain, then chain one. Cut your yarn and pull it through the chain. </li>
        <li>Pull your knot tight and weave in your ends.</li>
        <li>Stick your googly eyes onto the worry worm's head. Alternatively, embroider eyes using your second yarn color. French knots work well for this.</li>
        <li> That's it! Your worry worm is complete. See? Fast and easy!</li>
    </ol>
