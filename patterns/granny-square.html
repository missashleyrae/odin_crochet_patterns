    <h2>Basic Granny Square</h2>
    <img src="../img/grannysquare.png">
    <p class="intro">Granny squares are one of the most popular and versatile crochet projects. They can be as big or small as you want them to be, and can be stitched together to make things like blankets, pillows, table runners, and even clothing. There are many variations on the granny square, but this pattern is the most basic, beginner-friendly type. We'll stick to one color for now, but once you get the hang of it you can also switch colors as many times as you want. You'll soon find out that it's a very repetitive stitch pattern, so you can do it almost mindlessly while listening to a podcast or audiobook.</p>

    <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Yarn of your choice</li>
        <li>An appropriately sized crochet hook (the wrapper on your yarn should give you a suggested hook size)</li>
        <li>Scissors</li>
        <li>A yarn needle</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make the granny square:</h3>
    <h4>First Round</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Make a magic ring.</li>
            <p>Making a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsWmVcp9RMU">magic ring</a> can be a little tricky at first, but with practice you'll get the hang of it. This is an extremely useful skill to learn for projects worked in the round, like this one. </p>
        <li>Chain three.</li>
        <li>Into the middle of your magic ring, do two double crochets. Chain three again, which will form the first corner of your granny square.</li>
        <li>Make three double crochets into the center of the magic ring. Then, chain three to form the second corner of the square.</li>
        <li>Make three more double crochets into the center of the magic ring, then chain three to form the third corner of the square.</li>
        <li>Make three double crochets into the center of the magic ring, then chain three to form the fourth, and final, corner of the square. (See? I told you it's repetitive!)</li>
        <li>Use a slip stitch to connect to your first chain three to finish the round.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Second Round</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Flip your work horizontally.</li>
        <li>Chain three.</li>
        <li>Make two double crochets into the chain three space from the previous round. Chain three to form the first corner of this round. Then, make three more double crochets into the same space. On this round, and all subsequent rounds, you only need to chain three when forming a corner.</li>
        <li>Without making any chains, make three double crochets into the next corner space. Chain three to form the corner, then make three more double crochets into the same chain three space.</li>
        <li>Continue this pattern until you've finished the round. Slip stitch to end the round, and flip your work horizontally.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>All Further Rounds</h4>
    <p>For the rest of the rounds until your sqauare is the size you want it to be, double crochet into each chain three space without doing a chain three in between. Only when you come to a corner should you make three double crochets, chain three, then make three more double crochets into the same space. This is how the corners on all rounds of the granny square are formed.</p>

    <h4>Finishing the Granny Square</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>After your final slip stitch ending your final round, keep the loop on your hook. Cut the yarn, leaving at least a six-inch tail. Grab the yarn with your hook and pull it through the loop. Tighten the knot.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5en8s56K30">Weave in your ends</a>, both the tail you just cut and the tail at the beginning of your work, in the center of your square.</li>
    </ol>
